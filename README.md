Markout - Formatted Markdown in your Terminal!
=============================================

Ever get tired of `cat`ing simple, unformatted markdown files? I do.
That's why I wrote Markout! Also I was told I had to use the name.

### Usage
Markout's usage is simple:

```
$ ruby ./markout.rb ./README.md
```

This prints nice, coloured markdown in your shell!


### Isn't the point of markdown that you can read it unformatted?
*No further questions*
